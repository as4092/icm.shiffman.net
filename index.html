<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>This site organizes a series of video lessons for my <a href="https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2013">Introduction to Computational Media</a> course at ITP.  The videos also loosely follow my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123736021/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0123736021&linkCode=as2&tag=shiffman-20">Learning Processing</a>.  I also have a more advanced video series: <a href="http://video.natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> that follows my <a href="http://natureofcode.com">other book</a> of the same title.</p>

<p>I've only got about 1/3rd of the videos here so far.  Stay tuned for more to come!</p>

<h2>Help</h2>

<p>This is an experiment and there's lots of room for improvement.  If you'd like to learn more about how these lessons were made, you can <a href="http://shiffman.net/2013/08/01/video-lesson-documentation/">read this post</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/71476071">watch this video</a>.

<p>If you'd like to report a bug in this site or a technical problem with one of the videos, you can <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/icm.shiffman.net/issues">file a github issue</a>.  This site is a work in progress and we will also gladly <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/icm.shiffman.net/">accept contributions</a>.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>If you have questions about the video content and examples, please use the comments on each page.  I am curious as to whether this is a useful format for queries and discussion around the content.</p>

<h2>Annotations</h2>

<p>You'll notice under each video there is an annotation box.</p>

<div class="box">
	<p>This is what an annotation looks like.  It might <a href="http://www.google.com">have a link in it</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The annotations are timecoded and appear for a block of time in the video.  If you would like to help contribute to the annotations, <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/icm.shiffman.net/blob/gh-pages/README.md">there is more info on github</a>.</p>
